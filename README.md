# Updated_Virtual_Assistant
I have made a virtual assistant with Python using Google Speech Recognition API and many different modules.
#In this project,

Libraries used are:-
  datetime
  webbrowser
  wikipedia
  random
  os
  requests
  gTTS
  speech_recognition
  playsound
  urllib

What can this assistant do:-
  It can tell you the date and time
  It can open any site
  It can search on google without opening the browser manually
  It can give you the information about any topic from wikipedia
  It can write and save a note in the desktop
  It can tell you the weather of any city around the world

You people are free to use this module as a template and can make necessary changes according to your wish. You can mail me if you have any queries.
